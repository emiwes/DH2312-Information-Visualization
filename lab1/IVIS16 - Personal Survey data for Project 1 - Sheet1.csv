What I like:
----------------
I am a person who enjoys to improve a non-finished product. It can be anything from an idea, concepts, prototypes or softwares to a better, more appealing, better user experience, ""this is the way this product should be"" way. 

I also like to brainstorming and come up with unique ideas to reach where we really want. (Because great ideas usually does not come out of the blue).

------------------------------
Who I work best with:
------------------------------
I work best with people who does not care about small things and wants to go forward and sees on the bright side of the project. I also work good with people who criticises ones idea to make so that it is possible to come up with even better ideas!

I also have an interest in technology. As someone coming from the IT program I think I've been kind of colored by the people interested in low level programming. I'm kind of missing the ASM and C work we did back in the Computer Technology (?) course. (I'm kind of looking at how it is to work with a Gameboy in my spare time.)

As for more conventional hobbies I guess I like to play games? But lately it has been more reading about games as an art form than actually playing them. Reading about art is something I find really interesting.

I also listen to a lot of music, be it while I studying alone, while I travel to school/home, when I play games, or doing nothing else. I can enjoy more ""difficult"" music that requires focus to enjoy, as well as more conventional music. I really liked the ""The Fetus Speaks"" project as a concept.

Of all senses of the human body, vision is my favourite one. I believe that visual media are some of the most powerful at our disposal, in terms of speech and information density. A good narrative should nonetheless never be underestimated, as I believe that people process information best in story form.

Master in Science,I've been very fascinated by computer graphics ever since I started playing computer games as a kid. Gaming is still one of my favorite hobbies. I also like to play chess during my spare time as well as enjoying cross-country skiing during the winter season.,Using computer graphics as a tool of presenting information in such ways that it can be nicely interpreted by the users. I see this as an opportunity to add something to my portfolio and also to widen my knowledge within the field of computer graphics and its' areas of application.,7,5,5,3,8,7,7,9,5
Master in Science,"I like the idea of a full-stack developer which is why I started in Computer Science and went on to pursue a masters degree in HCI. Interaction design is my main interest but visualization is a fascinating field.

I like graphic design and have some experience working with it, mainly in the motocross business which is another hobby of mine which I also compete in.",I want to learn the process of taking raw data and creating something insightful and beautiful. I want to learn the common methodology and approaches to different types of visualizations.,7,5,7,7,9,6,5,8,7
Master in Science,"Music and arts have been my passions for as long as I can remember. It is also very important to be in nature. Every year I spend 2 months on an island in Finland where I sail and build things. Furthermore I have a new interest every year. My interests this year is to boulder and do trekking routes. A this moment I'm in Patagonia and have just completed the famous ""W"" route, Torres del Paine. (Don't worry i will be back on Monday!)
I choose to study media technology because of my passion fort art, engineering and my constant search on gaining new knowledge. During my time at KTH I have also gotten interest in design, programming and startups. Everytime I'm in a group project where I have the chance to learn something new, I will take it. ",mastering information visualisation is useful and can be very powerful. Something we have seen that Hans Rosling is very successful at.

Master in Science,"My name is Juho and I have skills in creative and technical side of designing usable UIs.

I am interested in traveling, nature, technology, public speaking and crafts of all kinds. I am also interested in computer animation(moving images), design and entrepreneurship. 

In a free time I play the guitar and visit places, go trekking and biking. I am interesting in learning to do sculpting. ","I would like to learn to represent and analyze data in visualizations in a meaningful and sophisticated way. I also would like to learn more about user centered process and enrich Graphic Design skills.

I wish that we could use visualization data in the presentations in the future and also add the visualizations to videos and documents. To build top notch online applications and interacting with mobile devices. Something to show: portfolio, building a team for entrepreneurial purposes.",8,6,4,9,8,7,6,7,8
Master in Science,"Hiho!

I am a pretty active guy that likes to test new things in order to really find out who I am and what I enjoy doing. Overall I like games, which ranges from playing video games to play badminton, in which i compete and i´ve been dancing swing for some years. I´m kind of interested in interior design and design overall and i've been spending some time in illustrator and autocad and some other artistic programs and i'm heading in the direction that I want to learn more about web programming and webdesign. ",I expect to learn how do visualize things in more ways than a do now and to get different kinds of perspectives on how other would visualize things and I think i will learn in by getting tips of software's to use and then learn by doing and then compare with the other student. ,6,6,3,9,9,3,1,2,2

Be able to better visualise with the data I've gotten and learn how to properly gather that data in the first place.
What an ideal group actually is.
Learn more about using d3.js.
Learn what types of different visualisations works for. How is the data clearer when presented depending on the information and target group?

It doesn't end with just having data. You also have to know how to use it and that is what I expect to use it for. ",4,3,5,6,7,3,1,1,8

Master in Science,"My name is Jonathan Söderin and I'm 22 years old. I'm the oldest of five brothers and I one of my hobbies are video games. I play both on the PS4, Xbox One and on the PC, I love playing with others since I am a very social person. I also love socializing offline and therefore I have been active in the reception here at media technology where I am studying. 2015 was the third year I was active in the reception and this time I was head of the reception and planned the whole thing together with two others. I love working in projects so this was the perfect opportunity for me to work in a way I love with something I love.","I expect to learn how to effectively show information in a way that makes it easy to understand for others and in a way that has impact. I expect to further develop my coding skills, something I really hope to get out from this course.

Master in Science,"I am quite a creative person and I am very curious. This is why all creative fields interest me and I've tried out most of them. I love drawing and I'd say I'm alright, not an expert but decent. I've been singing since the day I learned how to speak and music is one of my interests. I love working in teams and projects because I am drawn to people and creepily enough like to observe behavioural patterns within groups. In my free time I play a lot of video games and have done that since a young age. When I'm not gaming I read books, lots of them, mostly romatic novels, fantasy and mystery. I really like to work with my hands and especially fix physical things that are broken. There is something satisfactory in screwing in that last screw and knowing it will work. ","I expect to get the tools to be able to, in my future line of work, in an easy and understandable way decribe information, networks etc. for a group of people who are not as familiar with the data as I am.
